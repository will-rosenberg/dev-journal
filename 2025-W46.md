# 2025 Week 46 (Nov 10-16)

Mon-Wed:
- Have been busy with trying to make sales in my business to get the bills paid, as well as delivering to my new & existing clients.
- Did make some cool updates to my app (not yet committed to repo though, still fleshing it out) to include wavesurfer and have a waveform plus spectrogram view for my transcript viewer/editor. Including ability to edit transcript words and their time alignment more efficiently using that new UI.
  
Thu:
- Attended first [Virtual Coffee](https://virtualcoffee.io/) call. It was awesome! Great people and great ideas for my journey deeper into the magical world of software. Going to prioritize local meetups more (AKA I still need to go to my first one and am gonna make that happen very soon).
