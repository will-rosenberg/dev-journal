# 2025 Week 48 (Nov 24-30)

Mon-Wed:
- Applied to a handful of software jobs.
- Had a 1:1 call with someone I met from Virtual Coffee (software-related group)
- Lots of focus on my business (not so much the software side of things) to keep the lights on.

Thu:
- Great call with [Virtual Coffee](https://virtualcoffee.io) members today. Got feedback on my resume, possible approaches to getting a SW job (reinforced the value of referrals), and considerations around my code being public vs private, and more. Seems like I'm on the right track. Here are some changes I'm making as a result of the conversation:
  - Clarify repo is not accepting contributions/issues. Close the 2 issues that were opened as not planned, hide issues tab, update Contributing section to clarify.
  - Consider adding faster demo/login capability for people to test the app. ("Try on PWD"?)
  - Take the code even more seriously. One person mentioned that when conducting an interview, they would look at the code and want to hear me explain my reasoning behind things... and they don't even care so much about the app itself / what it does - that surprised me but also makes sense. But also caveated with: everyone wants something different at the interview process - don't assume all companies/people are looking for the same things.
  - Improve your GitHub profile/repo regarding:
    - story of your app (began as solving a problem for my users/clients, shipping and evolving an MVP without the code needing to be professional and super high quality... then saw opportunity to pursue full-stack career and am professionalizing code)
    - similar context/documentation of what code is hand-coded by me vs AI-assisted and/or vibe-coded
    - consider your hireability based on your GitHub alone - "how much professionalism can I demonstrate from this space?" (GitHub can serve as portfolio/resume of sorts)
      - consider using Projects tab
      - improve your code, keep professionalizing

Sat:
