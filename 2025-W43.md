Thu:
- Began this journal to help me get a full-stack developer job and document my journey for myself, too.
- Miscellaneous recent happenings:
  - I made my production web app [public](https://github.com/simpleamericanaccent/saa-app-web) instead of private, so it could be part of my [portfolio](https://williamrosenberg.com).
  - A friend recommended I add unit testing to my web app, using Jest. And maybe Storybook as a bonus.
    - I implemented a couple simple tests and plan to add more.
  - I have applied to lots of jobs and am figuring out my resume and portfolio.
  - **Failed multiple coding assessments for interview screening** (LeetCode-style). I've been relying on Cursor and autocomplete too much and struggled without them. Time to kick out the crutches and start a Rocky cutscene.
    - One was about manipulating and traversing graphs as arrays. One was about about using React to get data from a URL and display it in a special way.
    - Both seemed like they should be "easy"... yet I struggled & didn't figure them out within the time limit. A humbling and motivating experience.
  - Started exploring common categories of DS&A / interview problems, at a high level, and building some pattern recognition.
  - Decided to focus on arrays and strings first, to get a foothold.
  - Started diving deep into Unicode code points, ASCII, UTF-8, UTF-16, etc. Got curious about how things are sent over the wire. 
    - What is a string, *really*? Or the letter(s) T? Fascinating.
  - It seems like strings are more similar to arrays than I thought.
