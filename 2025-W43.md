Thu:
- Began this journal to help me get a job as a full-stack engineer and document my journey for myself, too.
- Miscellaneous recent happenings:
  - I made my production web app [public](https://github.com/simpleamericanaccent/saa-app-web) instead of private, so it could be part of my [portfolio](https://williamrosenberg.com).
  - A friend recommended I add unit testing to my web app, using Jest. And maybe Storybook as a bonus.
    - I implemented a couple simple tests and plan to add more.
  - I have applied to lots of jobs and am figuring out my resume and portfolio.
  - **Failed multiple coding assessments for interview screening** (LeetCode-style). I've been relying on Cursor and autocomplete too much and struggled without them. Time to kick out the crutches. Cue the Rocky training montage.
    - One was about manipulating and traversing graphs as arrays. One was about about using React to get data from a URL and display it in a special way.
    - Both seemed like they should be "easy"... yet I struggled & didn't figure them out within the time limit. A humbling and motivating experience.
    - I'm planning to drill those exact problems (and similar problems) soon.
  - Started exploring common categories of DS&A / interview problems, at a high level, and building some pattern recognition.
  - Decided to focus on arrays and strings first, to get a foothold.
  - Started diving deep (maybe too deep, but this obsessiveness often seems to pay off) into Unicode code points, ASCII, UTF-8, UTF-16, etc. Got curious about how things are sent over the wire. 
    - What is a string, *really*? Or the letter(s) T? Fascinating.
  - It seems like strings are more similar to arrays than I thought.
- Today:
  - Another software engineer friend offered some quick thoughts:
    - given my mechanical engineering degree plus personal project, I should be able to get a job fairly easily
    - keep practicing LeetCode, expect maybe an easy and a medium for a beginner role
    - research try catch blocks, when to use different loops, pass by value vs pass by reference, data structures (try building my own hash table in JavaScript)
  - further developed my plan of attack for portolio/skill development, to get a job.
    - Collected some useful [resources](https://github.com/will-rosenberg/dev-journal/blob/main/resources.md) into my bookmarks, considering a pretty intense daily/weekly training cadence of some sort.
    - Researching how I might be able to kill two birds with one stone and practice in public... maybe have a website fed by a repo (maybe this one) where I practice and automatically publish whatever I'm training (JS kata/problems, mini-apps, etc). Maybe be able to see the code on the site, as well as execute it and see if tests pass... and/or play around with the mini-apps, etc. Maybe using [WebContainers](https://webcontainers.io/)?
    - Also considering keeping it simple... maybe polish my web app and maybe one or two other mini-projects (if even needed), do a bunch of LeetCode, and apply to a lot of places as well as more targeted networking and reachouts.
    - Realizing I should keep talking with people I know in the software world (and meeting more) to help reduce my ignorance - am I focusing on the right things, in the right amounts? I imagine I should probably weight referrals higher than cold applications.
  - Posted on LinkedIn about actively looking for a full-stack engineer role.
    - According to Plausible Analytics, 7 unique visitors to my portfolio site so far from that post.
    - A former client (who is in the software world and awesome) reposted my post, speaking highly of me. That made me happy. A nice boost of confidence :-) Very grateful.

Fri:
- Reading [*30 Seconds of Code*](https://www.30secondsofcode.org) for some inspiration on how to build a website from a repo and also learning from the content itself.
- In Firefox devtools, exploring String, String.prototype, Array.prototype, etc. Also noticing I can type in String.fromCharCode(60) without hitting enter and it shows a preview of the output, so I can change the number in the parentheses and see the output faster. A faster feedback loop is valuable!
- Started to wonder... why does Firefox devtools show more info than other execution environments? For instance, compare simply typing `String` & hitting enter in Firefox devtools vs in a Node environment (e.g. https://node.codeutility.io/). Or `console.log(String)` or `console.log(String.prototype)`. We can expose more in a Node environment with something like `console.log(Object.getOwnPropertyNames(String.prototype));`... but still. DevTools allows us to see a lot more and dive deeper, interactively.
- For LeetCode-style challenges where I'm not supposed to use outside documentation, it sure would be handy if I could see devtools-level interactivity like this. I can simply type and enter `String`, click to expand `function String()` to see the static methods available, and click to expand `prototype: String { "" }` to see the instance/prototype methods available. Huh. Super cool. Maybe I could kinda hack my way around this even in a Node environment using something like `console.log(Object.getOwnPropertyNames(String.prototype));` or maybe it could be ok to open devtools on the LeetCode tab, not sure. Worth exploring. This would mean I don't have to remember as much... and can quickly check syntax / what I have available to me in my toolbox for working with strings, arrays, and so on. Straight from the source of truth, or something close to it. I guess that JS is sort of self-documenting? Maybe all languages are, if I'm smart enough? Not sure yet!
  - > Inspired by how *30 Seconds of Code* mentioned `something.prototype.somethingElse()` in [various](https://www.30secondsofcode.org/js/s/join-url-segments/#:~:text=Array.prototype.join%28%29) [places](https://www.30secondsofcode.org/js/s/currying/#:~:text=Function.prototype.bind%28%29), which led me to [this ChatGPT convo](https://chatgpt.com/share/68fb9c66-57f8-8011-90c6-a82d72aaaf20), [*MDN Web Docs*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String), and manual testing in both firefox devtools & a Node environment
- Whoa, I just realized that *MDN Web Docs* is created from Markdown files [in a repo](https://github.com/mdn/content) too! Cool. So this seems like a pretty established pattern that I could use. Maybe I'll end up doing that for this journal, or some evolution of it.
- <details><summary>Learning JS is kinda like learning math (the importance of deep connections, not just memorizing)</summary>Reflection: I think part of why I am "good" at math (and continue to be even when out of practice) is that I learned things deeply to a point where I could derive things from first principles (or something like that). So if I forgot something, I could often arrive at it again, on my own. I think a similar approach for software will probably be valuable. So while part of me feels insecure that I might be diving "too deep" into some of this stuff, another part of me suspects that it will create a strong foundation that will pay off for the rest of my life. It's the type of foundational work that might be tough to convince some managers of its value in terms of short term ROI, but that somewhere deep down I'm convinced is extremely valuable and is a great investment for me to make. I think understanding JavaScript at a deeper level and being able to rediscover its syntax in a sort of self-documenting way would fall into this kind of category. I imagine I will use that over and over moving forward. I also think similar investments in the feedback loop I'm using will pay off - being able to test something out and see its results faster. Sometime it might be premature investment or overengineering or something like that. But I think that I feel good about diving deeper into those areas right now. My process doesn't have to be "perfect"... things will keep adding up over time, even if it's a bit messy or non-ideal according to some perspectives. Not everyone has to agree with my approach. I'm enjoying making my own path. And it's still on my own hours, not another company's hours, so I'm basically the only one I have to justify the ROI to.</details>
- Reflection: another benefit of this journal is I feel more comfortable closing browser tabs (literally and figuratively in my own mind) when I know I've documented something here in the journal already. Even if it's messy, it's somewhere in here and could be recovered.
- Crazy idea: I could probably memorize syntax for some sort of loop over Object.getOwnPropertyNames(); with different entities (String, Array, etc) to get available syntax even in more closed environments such as LeetCode. Or without a loop, just use for one-off lookups as needed. Just tested it and confirmed it works. Cool. Maybe this would impress someone somewhere... but more importantly it's immediately going to be useful for me.
- Might be useful to learn more mouseless workflows too. Both for understanding accessibility concerns for some endusers, as well my own accessibility and efficiency.
- Great details on JS execution model [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Execution_model)
- Doing some LeetCode, focusng on strings
- idea: every day accomplish all 4 of these (ideally) and document here what you did:
  - apply for jobs
  - reach out / talk to someone who works in software (warm, cold, just to talk / explore SW ideas / ask advice, to seek a job at their company... it can be anything)
  - improve portfolio (e.g. your business's web app and/or other portfolio aspects) - maybe this can include the "funnel" in general... resume, linkedin, etc
  - do LeetCode (or similar platform) - and as a bonus do some sort of deep dive into related skills
- Working on the [80/20 of string properties](https://github.com/will-rosenberg/dev-journal/blob/main/js.md), to help with LeetCode and beyond (will probably extend to other objects soon)
- Completed 2 Easy LeetCode problems
  - https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-index-of-the-first-occurrence-in-a-string
  - https://leetcode.com/problems/roman-to-integer
- Tried 1 Hard LeetCode problem, did not complete yet
  - https://leetcode.com/problems/substring-with-concatenation-of-all-words/

Sat:
- Applied to 6 companies/roles.

Sun:
- My business's app has been only for clients so far. I intentionally turned off the "sign up" functionality and have been manually creating accounts for my clients. 
- I'm considering killing two birds with one stone:
    - I'm already working to professionalize my app, to help me get a job as a full-stack engineer using my app as a portfolio piece
    - So I figure: why not make my app public while I'm at it? I can turn on public "sign up" functionality, update app with onboarding, gate client-only content / add CTAs, and actively promote to my audience
- It may take a while before I get a job, let alone receive my first paycheck. So for cashflow purposes, I need to keep my business generating enough cash to pay the bills at least until then, despite me shifting almost all my attention towards getting a software job. This might help give business cashflow a boost to cover this transitional period.
