Thu:
- Began this journal to help me get a job as a full-stack engineer and document my journey for myself, too.
- Miscellaneous recent happenings:
  - I made my production web app [public](https://github.com/simpleamericanaccent/saa-app-web) instead of private, so it could be part of my [portfolio](https://williamrosenberg.com).
  - A friend recommended I add unit testing to my web app, using Jest. And maybe Storybook as a bonus.
    - I implemented a couple simple tests and plan to add more.
  - I have applied to lots of jobs and am figuring out my resume and portfolio.
  - **Failed multiple coding assessments for interview screening** (LeetCode-style). I've been relying on Cursor and autocomplete too much and struggled without them. Time to kick out the crutches. Cue the Rocky training montage.
    - One was about manipulating and traversing graphs as arrays. One was about about using React to get data from a URL and display it in a special way.
    - Both seemed like they should be "easy"... yet I struggled & didn't figure them out within the time limit. A humbling and motivating experience.
    - I'm planning to drill those exact problems (and similar problems) soon.
  - Started exploring common categories of DS&A / interview problems, at a high level, and building some pattern recognition.
  - Decided to focus on arrays and strings first, to get a foothold.
  - Started diving deep (maybe too deep, but this obsessiveness often seems to pay off) into Unicode code points, ASCII, UTF-8, UTF-16, etc. Got curious about how things are sent over the wire. 
    - What is a string, *really*? Or the letter(s) T? Fascinating.
  - It seems like strings are more similar to arrays than I thought.
- Today:
  - Another software engineer friend offered some quick thoughts:
    - given my mechanical engineering degree plus personal project, I should be able to get a job fairly easily
    - keep practicing LeetCode, expect maybe an easy and a medium for a beginner role
    - research try catch blocks, when to use different loops, pass by value vs pass by reference, data structures (try building my own hash table in JavaScript)
  - further developed my plan of attack for portolio/skill development, to get a job.
    - Collected some useful [resources](https://github.com/will-rosenberg/dev-journal/blob/main/resources.md) into my bookmarks, considering a pretty intense daily/weekly training cadence of some sort.
    - Researching how I might be able to kill two birds with one stone and practice in public... maybe have a website fed by a repo (maybe this one) where I practice and automatically publish whatever I'm training (JS kata/problems, mini-apps, etc). Maybe be able to see the code on the site, as well as execute it and see if tests pass... and/or play around with the mini-apps, etc.
    - Also considering keeping it simple... maybe polish my web app and maybe one or two other mini-projects (if even needed), do a bunch of LeetCode, and apply to a lot of places as well as more targeted networking and reachouts.
    - Realizing I should keep talking with people I know in the software world (and meeting more) to help reduce my ignorance - am I focusing on the right things, in the right amounts? I imagine I should probably weight referrals higher than cold applications.
  - Posted on LinkedIn about actively looking for a full-stack engineer role.
    - According to Plausible Analytics, 7 unique visitors to my portfolio site so far from that post.
    - A former client (who is in the software world and awesome) reposted my post, speaking highly of me. That made me happy. A nice boost of confidence :-) Very grateful.
