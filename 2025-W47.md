# 2025 Week 47 (Nov 17-23)

Mon-Sun:
- Made HTML/CSS version of my resume so I can version control it in GitHub as well as have more control over its exact layout and so on.
- Attended more Virtual Coffee stuff, soaking up lots of good stuff for my software career.
- Slowly building a computer from logic gates for the first time, using Logic.ly. Each of the white boxes is a custom integrated circuit that I built, with logic gates and/or more custom ICs inside. Learning a lot! Programming is making more sense with this context now.
- Had a deep discussion with ChatGPT around the following thought experiment: imagine you're immortal and the only human on Earth. There are no man-made materials/resources, just nature. How long would it take you to build a modern-day computer? You have access to all of mankind's knowledge. Can also explore video game speedrunning concepts applied to this... e.g. allow yourself to restart as much as you'd like. Say it starts the same every time and/or you can control the seed and already know where all the resources are, so you can design the perfect routes and so on. Was interesting to dive deep into what raw materials would be needed, what processes, how technology builds on itself, how we might be able to skip certain aspects, and so on.
