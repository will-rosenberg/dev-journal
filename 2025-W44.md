# 2025 Week 44 (Oct 27 - Nov 2)

Mon:
- In my Simple American Accent web app: temporarily made new "Accent Explorer" page admin-only while I improve it.
- Lots of updates to app ([17 commits today](https://github.com/SimpleAmericanAccent/saa-app-web/commits/main/?since=2025-10-27&until=2025-10-27))... and made the Accent Explorer (now Accent Targets) available to users again
  - Used Cursor AI a lot, tried to keep within fixed scope to limit potential blast radius. Didn't review 100% within that scope, there's stuff I am pushing out with a "looks about right" to get MVP for new functionality out
  - Ultimately: got a decent MVP version of Accent Explorer/Targets up and running. And cleaned up a few other things along the way.
- Also had another new user start using the Quiz for the first time today and they gave positive feedback ("I'm loving it")

Tue:
- Learning about best practices for planning/managing: features/project/product. 
  - Currently I have an [Issue](https://github.com/SimpleAmericanAccent/saa-app-web/issues/117) that collects a big brainstorm of ideas to improve the app. But it's too big and is overwhelming to look at / not very usable. 
  - ChatGPT mentioned this as a possible flow:
    - IDEAS.md → GitHub Issue → GitHub Project → Feature branch → PR → Done ✅
- Continuing to work on my business's app:
  - In Accent Explorer(/Targets), added ability to see top 20-100 most frequent words for each target phoneme. Also added button to send these to ChatGPT to generate phrases using these words.
  - Explored some ideas I haven't implemented yet:
    - Auth0 alternate auth options... passwordless, socials, etc. And how to link accounts when one person has multiple ways to log in, without security issues.
    - Linking from Quiz to Accent Explorer
    - Consolidating/refactoring lots across the app - currently have some things defined in multiple places, need to centralize into one source of truth.
  - Working on refactoring transcript-viewer-v1 to separate concerns better / have better composition... and/also make it easier to test... then want to set up testing for it (Jest & Storybook, at least)
    - Actually, maybe I'll make tests first, then refactor while making sure tests keep passing. Not sure yet, but that would be cool if I could get that to work.
    - Started pulling out some of the tooltip content into separate component(s). Still in same file at first, then may eventually move to separate file(s).
  
Wed:
- Continuing to work on my business's app:
  - To support refactoring and testing, trying to better understand what depends on what in my code, key concepts (API, signature, props, shape, seams, etc), key approaches to use, etc
    - Installed dependency-cruiser and graphviz. Learning to use those and Cursor's built-in abilities to navigate my code better and see connections between variables, functions, files, etc.
    - Also looked into ts-morph a bit and played around with [TypeScript AST Viewer](https://ts-ast-viewer.com/)
