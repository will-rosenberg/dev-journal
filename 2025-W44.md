# 2025 Week 44 (Oct 27 - Nov 2)

Mon:
- In my Simple American Accent web app: temporarily made new "Accent Explorer" page admin-only while I improve it.
- Lots of updates to app (17 commits today)... and made the Accent Explorer (now Accent Targets) available to users again
  - Used Cursor AI a lot, tried to keep within fixed scope to limit potential blast radius. Didn't review 100% within that scope, there's stuff I am pushing out with a "looks about right" to get MVP for new functionality out
  - Ultimately: got a decent MVP version of Accent Explorer/Targets up and running. And cleaned up a few other things along the way.
- Also had another new user start using the Quiz for the first time today and they gave positive feedback ("I'm loving it")
