I'm starting this journal to document my journey to get a job as a full-stack engineer and beyond (ongoing skill improvements, etc).

It's primarily for myself (so it may be messy, high amounts of detail, etc), but I may use it to create more audience-friendly formats, too.

And regarding my journey as a full-stack engineer:

I've already built a [full-stack web app](https://williamrosenberg.com) that my paying accent coaching clients use.

I've really been enjoying developing software and want to spend way more of my time doing that... 

...and way less time making Instagram Reels, marketing, selling, and so on. Social media is bumming me out, and I don't like having my income tied to that.

So I've decided to get a full-time job as a full-stack engineer. (I plan to keep running my accent coaching business on the side, but in a much lighter way - probably more focused on product and less focused on marketing.)

This is my record of this journey.

I'm already in the thick of things. Recently started applying to jobs, but not yet employed.

Time to turn pro.

> A note on formatting: I decided to use [ISO week numbering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Week_dates) to organize the journal entries.
