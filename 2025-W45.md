# 2025 Week 45 (Nov 3-9)

Mon:
- Made more progress on phoneme space exploration - this will likely become part of my business's app

Tue:
- Updated marketing website. Specifically the [page about my 1:1 accent coaching services](https://simpleamericanaccent.com/1on1)
- Noticing plenty of issues with my marketing website overall. Lots of inconsistencies due to creating things as needed using Cursor Agent and not being careful enough / not investing enough time to clean things up. Also it's all vanilla js/html/css (except for some exceptions where react used via cdn import thing)... could be good to review my overall approach to development and deployment for this website. Maybe use React or an approach that allows components/reuse, maybe include some testing, etc. TBD.
  
Wed:
- Cleaning up [my business's website](https://simpleamericanaccent.com). Removing and/or cleaning up old pages leftover from Wordpress/Elementor. Reviewing code and considered how to refactor / deploy better moving forward. Considering switching from vanilla JS deployed via Cloudflare... to Astro and/or React deployed via Cloudflare. TBD.
- Haven't made as much progress directly on the full-stack engineer employment path recently - have had to refocus on business cashflow to get the shorter term bills paid. Looking forward to making some more sales and being able to push more on the job hunt / skill development front.
  - Note: I haven't noted business marketing / sales / delivery activity here, unless related to software in some way. I have been doing that work though, outside of what I've noted here.
