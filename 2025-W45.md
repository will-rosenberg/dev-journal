# 2025 Week 45 (Nov 3-9)

Mon:
- Made more progress on phoneme space exploration - this will likely become part of my business's app

Tue:
- Updated marketing website. Specifically the [page about my 1:1 accent coaching services](https://simpleamericanaccent.com/1on1)
- Noticing plenty of issues with my marketing website overall. Lots of inconsistencies due to creating things as needed using Cursor Agent and not being careful enough / not investing enough time to clean things up. Also it's all vanilla js/html/css (except for some exceptions where react used via cdn import thing)... could be good to review my overall approach to development and deployment for this website. Maybe use React or an approach that allows components/reuse, maybe include some testing, etc. TBD.
