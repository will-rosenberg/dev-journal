# 2025 Week 45 (Nov 3-9)

Mon:
- Made more progress on phoneme space exploration - this will likely become part of my business's app

Tue:
- Updated marketing website. Specifically the [page about my 1:1 accent coaching services](https://simpleamericanaccent.com/1on1)
- Noticing plenty of issues with my marketing website overall. Lots of inconsistencies due to creating things as needed using Cursor Agent and not being careful enough / not investing enough time to clean things up. Also it's all vanilla js/html/css (except for some exceptions where react used via cdn import thing)... could be good to review my overall approach to development and deployment for this website. Maybe use React or an approach that allows components/reuse, maybe include some testing, etc. TBD.
  
Wed:
- Cleaning up [my business's website](https://simpleamericanaccent.com). Removing and/or cleaning up old pages leftover from Wordpress/Elementor. Reviewing code and considered how to refactor / deploy better moving forward. Considering switching from vanilla JS deployed via Cloudflare... to Astro and/or React deployed via Cloudflare. TBD.
- Haven't made as much progress directly on the full-stack engineer employment path recently - have had to refocus on business cashflow to get the shorter term bills paid. Looking forward to making some more sales and being able to push more on the job hunt / skill development front.
  - Note: I haven't noted business marketing / sales / delivery activity here, unless related to software in some way. I have been doing that work though, outside of what I've noted here. Including but not limited to creating and posting Instagram content, making offers, improving my funnel, following up with leads/applicants/clients, helping current clients, and so on.
- Had my weekly group call with clients (sort of "office hours" - today just one client showed up but we had a great 90 minute call). Great feedback on app (he's using it and likes it / finds it useful), and various ideas for improvements (directly from him and/or inspired by our conversation), including:
  - Audacity-like guided exploration of subphoneme details e.g. for BAN vs DRESS. I did this live with him and it helped him have an "aha" moment. I often do this live with clients. This is something I could do via content and/or software, without me needing to be there live.
  - Call notes with links, interactivity, etc. I've been taking notes in notepad and sending via WhatsApp, for my calls with this client, specifically. I realized I could create a similar format with a couple useful bells and whistles, via software. To keep all call notes in one place (instead of scattered across WhatsApp conversation), as well as linking to various resources (specific moments/feedback in Transcript Viewer, specific lessons/content, external resources, etc). Could also automate more of this notes generation/linking process, to make it easier for me and higher quality.
  - Could also have Transcript Viewer be able to output a similar sort of call-notes-style summary. Maybe something easy to consume on mobile, easy to read reminders about the main words/issues they need to work on. Maybe even just one page / all above the fold.
  - Could/should also ask my clients better and more consistently: what would make the program (not just software, but overall program/product/experience) stickier, more awesome, more valuable, etc.
